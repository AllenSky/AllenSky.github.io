本文是我在[Coursera]上来自于华盛顿大学的计算神经科学的学习总结。

​	Theoretical analysis and computational modeling are important too for characterizing what nervous system do, determining how they function, and understanding why  they operate in particular ways. Neuroscience encompasses approaches ranging form molecular and cellular studies to human psychophysics and psychology. Theoretical neuroscience encourages cross-talk among these sub-disciplines by constructing compact representations of what has been learned, building bridges between different levels of description, and identifying unifying concepts and principles. In this book, we present the basic methods used for these purposes and discuss examples in which theoretical approaches have yielded insight into nervous system function.

​	The questions what, how, and why are addressed by **descriptive, mechanistic, and interpretiv**e models, each of which we discuss in the following chapters. Descriptive models summarize large amounts of experimental data compactly yet accurately, there by characterizing what neurons and neural circuits do. These models may bee based loosely on biophysical, anatomical, and physiological findings, but their primary purpose is to describe phenomena not to explain them. Mechanistic models, one the other hand, address the question of how nervous systems operate on the basis of known anatomy, physiology, and circuitry. Such models often form a bridge between descriptive models couched at different levels. Interpretive models use computational and information-theoretic principles to explore the behavioral and cognitive significance of various aspects of nervous system function, addressing the question of why nervous system operate as they do.

​	Computational Neurosciences 是一门从分子学，细胞学到人类心理物理学和心理学的交叉学科。研究他的时候分为三个阶段：what, how, why，这三个阶段分别对应着descriptive model, mechanistic model, interpretive model
