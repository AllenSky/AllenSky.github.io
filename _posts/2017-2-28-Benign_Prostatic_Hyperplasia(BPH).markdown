# Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia(BPH) 前列腺增生
本文内容参考：[美国泌尿协会]。本人非医学相关人士，翻译不准确，仅为帮助家里老人了解**前列腺增生**。

##  Watchful Waiting/Active Surveillance
BPH is monitored but there is no active treatment. Diet and medicine can control symptoms. You will have a yearly exam. Your health care provider will look for worse or new symptoms before beginning active treatment.
_此时，患有BPH病人处于被观察状态，并无积极治疗。饮食和药物能够控制症状。病人应该参加每年的体检。在开始积极治疗之前，病人的健康保险提供者（觉得是指医生）会留意可能出现更坏的或新的症状。_
What Are The Benefits, Risks and Side Effects of Watchful Waiting/Active Surveillance?
**Watchful Waiting/Active Surveillance**的好处，风险和副作用有哪些？
There are no side effects. But it may be harder to reduce your symptoms later.
_没有副作用。但是可能很难减轻你的症状。_
**Who Are Good Candidates for Watchful Waiting/Active Surveillance?**
_谁是_**Watchful Waiting or Active Surveillance** 
_治疗方法的人群?_
Men with mild symptoms may be good candidates for this treatment. Men with moderate symptoms who are not bothered by the symptoms are also good candidates.
_温和症状的病人适合这种疗法。中等病症但并没有收到太多影响的病人也适合这种疗法。_

## Medical Therapies
### Alpha Blockers—Alpha抑制剂
Alpha blockers are pills that relax the muscles of the prostate and bladder. They improve urine flow. They reduce blockage. They reduce symptoms of BPH. The pills do not reduce the size of the prostate. Alpha blockers include alfuzosin (Uroxatral), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cadura) and tamsulosin (Flomax).
_Alpha抑制剂药物能放松前列腺和膀胱的肌肉，能改善排尿流速，减小尿道的阻碍，能减轻BPH的症状。药物却不能减少前列腺的大小。Alpha抑制剂包括alfuzosin (Uroxatral), terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cadura) and tamsulosin (Flomax)。_
**What are The Benefits, Risks and Side Effects of Alpha Blockers?**
_Alpha抑制剂的优势，风险和副作用有哪些呢？_
One benefit of alpha blockers is that they work right away. Side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, fatigue and difficulty ejaculating.
_这种alpha抑制剂的好处之一是能立即见效。副作用包括头晕目眩，疲劳和射精困难。_
**Who Are Good Candidates for Alpha Blockers?**
_谁是这种疗法适应人群呢？_
This treatment is good for men with moderate to severe BPH. Men who are bothered by their symptoms are good candidates. This is not a good choice if you are about to have cataract surgery.
_此疗法适合中等强度的BPH以及被病症困扰的患者。但对于即将开展cataract手术的病患不适合。_

### What Are 5-Alpha Reducatase Inhibitors?
**什么是5-Alpha还原抑制剂？**

5-Alpha reducatase inhibitors block the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT is a male hormone that plays a role in prostate development and growth. DHT accumulates in the prostate and may cause prostate growth. 5-Alpha reducatase inhibitors are pills that increase urine flow and shrink the prostate. These drugs include finasteride (Proscar) and dutasteride (Avodart).
_5-Alpha还原抑制剂能抑制双氢睾酮DHT的合成。DHT是一种雄性激素，它参与了前列腺发育和生长。DHT在前列腺中的积累，可能导致前列腺增生。5-Alpha还原抑制剂药物能增强尿液流速和收缩前列腺大小。这些药物包括非那雄胺（商品名：保列治） 和 度他雄胺 (适尿通)._
**What Are The benefits, Risks and Side Effects of 5-Alpha Reducatase Inhibitors?**
_5-Alpha还原抑制剂的优势，风险和副作用是哪些呢？_
These drugs lower the risk of BPH complications. They lower the need for surgery. Side effects are sexual, such as erectile dysfunction and reduced libido (sex drive). You must take them indefinitely to prevent symptoms.
_这些药物减少了BPH并发症的风险。他们降低了手术的需求。副作用是性方面的，比如勃起障碍，减少性欲（性冲动）。你必须无期限的服用以减少症状。_
**Who Are Good Candidates for 5-Alpha Reducatase Inhibitors?**
_谁是5-Alpha还原抑制剂疗法适应人群呢？_
These drugs may be best for men with very large prostate glands. Older men are good candidates.
这些药物可能非常适合于前列腺腺体增生十分明显的人群。老人也是适用人群。

### What is Combination Therapy?
_什么是联合疗法呢？_
Combination therapy uses an alpha blocker and a 5-alpha reducatase inhibitor together. Several studies, such as the Medical Therapy of Prostatic Symptoms (MTOPS) study, have shown that combining two classes of medications, instead of using just one, can more effectively improve symptoms, urinary flow, and quality of life. The combinations include:
联合疗法是同时使用alpha抑制剂和5-alpha还原抑制剂。许多研究表明，比如前列腺症状药物治疗研究（我也不知道翻译的合适不合适），已经表明结合这两种药物，而不是使用其中之一，能非常有效的改善症状，尿液流速和生活质量。联合疗法包括：
*  **Finasteride (Proscar) and doxazosin** 非那雄胺（商品名：保列治）和多沙唑嗪（这种药物对高血压也有效果，所以高血压，心脑血管病人要当心）
*  **dutasteride (Avodart) and tamsulosin (Jalyn ), a combination of both medications that is available in a single tablet** 度他雄胺(适尿通)和坦索罗辛（哈乐）（坦索罗辛，注意：血压下降、体位性低血压、心率加快、心悸）
*  alpha blockers and antimuscarinics Alpha抑制剂和抗毒蕈碱药

A urologist may prescribe a combination of alpha blockers and antimuscarinics for patients with overactive bladder symptoms. Overactive bladder is a condition in which the bladder muscles contract uncontrollably and cause urinary frequency, urinary urgency, and urinary incontinence. Antimuscarinics are a class of medications that relax the bladder muscles.
一个泌尿医生可能给病人开具alpha抑制剂和抗毒蕈碱药混合药物去坚决膀胱亢进问题。膀胱亢进是因为膀胱肌肉不可控制的收缩从而导致尿频，尿急和尿不尽。抗毒蕈碱药是一类能够放松膀胱肌肉的药物。

**What Are The Benefits, Risks and Side Effects of Combination Therapy?**
_联合疗法还原抑制剂的优势，风险和副作用是哪些呢？_

Alpha blockers and 5-alpha reducatase inhibiters work better together than either one alone. They prevent BPH from getting worse. They improve symptoms. But there may be more side effects. There may be side effects from each drug.
_Alpha抑制剂和5-alpha还原抑制剂联合起来比单独一种药物治疗效果更好。他们能防止BPH变得越来越坏。他们能改善病症。但是可能有更多的副作用，副作用和每种药物有关系。_
**Who Are good candidates for combination therapy?**
_谁是这种疗法适应人群呢？_
**Men with larger prostates are good candidates for this treatment.**
_前列腺增生严重的病人_

### What Are Phytotherapies?  什么是草本治疗？
These are herbal therapies. They are very popular. They are "self treatment." They are not prescribed by a health care provider. One popular herb is saw palmetto.
_草本治疗很流行，他们属于自我治疗。他们不属于医疗保险会提供的治疗方法。其中saw palmetto锯棕榈是很受欢迎的一种草本。_
**What Are The Benefits, Risks and Side Effects of Phytotherapies?**
_草本治疗的优势，风险和副作用是什么？_
Herbal treatments have not been proven to work. In fact, some studies show they do not work. Also, the quality and purity of these over-the-counter supplements vary.
_草本治疗没有被证明有效。事实上，有一些研究表明他们并没有效果。同时，这些非出发药物的质量和纯度供应相差很大。_
**Who are Good Candidates for Phytotherapies?**
_睡适合草本治疗？_
This treatment is not currently recommended by health care providers.
_这种疗法不被推荐给医疗保障系统内的病人使用。_
